### Code

We share the code used to evaluate the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in the **in_context_learning** folder, and the Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B models in the **fine_tuning** folder. For the fine-tuning experiments, we utilized Unsloth AI, an open-source platform for fine-tuning LLM models. Further information about Unsloth AI can be found at <https://unsloth.ai/>.
