Each placeholder may either be an entity or an event.\\nPlease note! Placeholders can ONLY be either an entity (i.e., noun phrase) or an event (i.e., verb phrase) and may not be any other type of phrase (e.g., prepositional phrase).\\n\\n# List of Templates\\nTemplate No.1:\\nPremise 1: An entity/event [A] promotes a good entity/event [C].\\nPremise 2: The absence of an entity/event [A] suppresses a good entity/event [C].\\nConclusion: Therefore, [A] should be brought about.\\n\\nTemplate No.2:\\nPremise 1: An entity/event [A] suppresses a bad entity/event [C]\\nPremise 2: The absence of an entity/event [A] promotes a bad entity/event [C].\\nConclusion: Therefore, [A] should be brought about.\\n\\nTemplate No.3:\\nPremise 1: An entity/event [A] suppresses a good entity/event [C]\\nPremise 2: The absence of an entity/event [A] promotes a good entity/event [C].\\nConclusion: Therefore, [A] should not be brought about.\\n\\nTemplate No.4:\\nPremise 1: An entity/event [A] promotes a bad entity/event [C]\\nPremise 2: The absence of an entity/event [A] suppresses a bad entity/event [C].\\nConclusion: Therefore, [A] should not be brought about.\\n\\nTemplate No.5:\\nThe argument cannot be instantiated with one of the templates above.\\n\\n# Output Format\\nTemplate No.=[No.]\\n[A]=\\n[C]=\\n\\n# Important Criteria: Prioritizing entities over events for placeholder.\\nFor choosing placeholder, please prioritize entities over events in the case that an entity itself captures the underlying intent of the argument opposed to the event. However, if the event makes more sense, please choose an event for the placeholder.\\n\\n# Correct Example\\nInput: To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don\\'t, we can\\'t have better schools.\\nOutput:\\nTemplate No.=1\\n[A]=raise taxes\\n[C]=schools\\nExplanation:\\nHere, there are 2 possible options for [C] which are \"schools\" (i.e., entity) and \"can\\'t have better schools\" (i.e., event). Since the entity is the top priority and the second option does not work with template 1 because it is a suppressed relation, \"schools\" is cchosen for [C].\\nAlso, [A] and [C] are taken directly from the input text. For example, \"raising taxes\" as [A] also sounds correct, but the term \"raising\" is not mentioned in the input text. That is why \"raise taxes\" is chosen for [A]. Because the argument believes that \"raise taxes\" promote \"schools\" while not \"raise taxes\" suppress \"school\". he conclusion is implicit that ‚ÄúPremise 1 supports that raise taxes should be brought about.‚Äù Thus, Template No.=1 is selected.\\n\\n# Wrong Example\\nInput: To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don\\'t, we can\\'t have better schools.\\nOutput:\\nTemplate No.=1\\n[A]=raising taxes\\n[C]=can\\'t have better schools\\nExplanation:\\nHere, there are 2 possible options for [C] which are \"schools\" (i.e., entity) and \"can\\'t have better schools\" (i.e., event). However, \"can\\'t have better schools\" as [C] is incorrect because it is an event instead of the entity of \"schools\" which already makes sense.\\nAlso, \"raising taxes\" as [A] is incorrect because the placeholder is not taken directly from the text. Here \"raising taxes\" is chosen as [A] but the word \"raising\" does not appear in the input text. Therefore the correct correct choice for [A] is \"raise taxes\".\\n\\nAgain, please only select the placeholders directly from the text!\\n\\n\\n### Input:\\nWe either have to cut taxes or leave a huge debt for our children.\\n\\n### Response:\\nTemplate No.=2\\n[A]=cut taxes\\n[C]=leave a huge debt for our children\\n</s>']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_json('other_dataset.json')"],"metadata":{"id":"fdNg4-thhvXo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721632241385,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1552,"user":{"displayName":"Irfan Robbani","userId":"06649445271139165828"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"ZI3ZRS4hR0A4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1721632247486,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Irfan Robbani","userId":"06649445271139165828"}},"outputId":"484f44d9-aaff-4262-a1d0-512fa813dd61"},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                   fallacy                                        instruction  \\\n","0    Faulty Generalization  #

Both options make sense as placeholders but since the entity is the top priority, \\\"four poor families\\\" is chosen for [A'].\\nAlso, [A], [C], and [A'] are taken directly from the input text. For example, \\\"every poor people\\\" as [A] also sounds correct, but the term \\\"every\\\" is not mentioned in the input text. That is why \\\"four poor families\\\" is chosen as [A]. Because the argument believes that \\\"four poor families\\\" is \\\"lazy drug addicts\\\" supports \\\"all poor people\\\" is \\\"lazy drug addicts\\\", the conclusion is implicit that \\\"Premise 1 supports that \\\"all poor people\\\" should not be brought about.\\\" Thus, Template No.=2 is selected.  \\n\\n# Wrong Example\\nInput: I know four poor families. They are lazy drug addicts. Therefore, all poor people are lazy drug addicts.\\nOutput:\\nTemplate No.=[No.]\\n[A]=every poor people\\n[C]=lazy drug addicts\\n[A']=know four poor families\\n[C']=\\nExplanation:\\nHere, there are 2 possible options for [A'] which are \\\"four poor families\\\" (i.e., entity) and \\\"know four poor families\\\" (i.e., event). However, \\\"know four poor families\\\" as [A'] is incorrect because it is an event instead of the entity which already makes sense.\\nAlso, \\\"every poor people\\\" as [A] is incorrect because the placeholder is not taken directly from the text. Here \\\"every poor people\\\" is chosen as [A] but the word \\\"every\\\" does not appear in the input text. Therefore the correct one to fill [A] is \\\"all poor people\\\".\\n\\nAgain, please only select the placeholders directly from the text!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No, because if you start with same sex marriage, what is next?
