Both options make sense as placeholders but since the entity is the top priority, \\\"four poor families\\\" is chosen for [A'].\\nAlso, [A], [C], and [A'] are taken directly from the input text. For example, \\\"every poor people\\\" as [A] also sounds correct, but the term \\\"every\\\" is not mentioned in the input text. That is why \\\"four poor families\\\" is chosen as [A]. Because the argument believes that \\\"four poor families\\\" is \\\"lazy drug addicts\\\" supports \\\"all poor people\\\" is \\\"lazy drug addicts\\\", the conclusion is implicit that \\\"Premise 1 supports that \\\"all poor people\\\" should not be brought about.\\\" Thus, Template No.=2 is selected.  \\n\\n# Wrong Example\\nInput: I know four poor families. They are lazy drug addicts. Therefore, all poor people are lazy drug addicts.\\nOutput:\\nTemplate No.=[No.]\\n[A]=every poor people\\n[C]=lazy drug addicts\\n[A']=know four poor families\\n[C']=\\nExplanation:\\nHere, there are 2 possible options for [A'] which are \\\"four poor families\\\" (i.e., entity) and \\\"know four poor families\\\" (i.e., event). However, \\\"know four poor families\\\" as [A'] is incorrect because it is an event instead of the entity which already makes sense.\\nAlso, \\\"every poor people\\\" as [A] is incorrect because the placeholder is not taken directly from the text. Here \\\"every poor people\\\" is chosen as [A] but the word \\\"every\\\" does not appear in the input text. Therefore the correct one to fill [A] is \\\"all poor people\\\".\\n\\nAgain, please only select the placeholders directly from the text!\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"input\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 60,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No, because if you start with same sex marriage, what is next?
