=== fallacy_structure_analysis: False Dilemma ===
# Task
Identify the underlying structure of a fallacious argument which is a False Dilemma.
Given a list of fallacy templates, your task is to choose a template that best describes the underlying fallacy structure, choosing the template's placeholders, [A] and [C], directly from the input text. Additionally, the text must be a consecutive sequence of one or more terms without any conjugation. Please follow the output format.

# Definitions
Entity: a noun phrase in the input.
Event: a verb phrase in the input.
Placeholder: A fill-in-the-blank choice within a template. Each placeholder may either be an entity or an event.
Please note! Placeholders can ONLY be either an entity (i.e., noun phrase) or an event (i.e., verb phrase) and may not be any other type of phrase (e.g., prepositional phrase).

# List of Templates
Template No.1:
Premise 1: An entity/event [A] promotes a good entity/event [C].
Premise 2: An entity/event [¬A] suppresses a good entity/event [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, both Premise 1 and Premise 2 support that [A] should be brought about.

Template No.2:
Premise 1: An entity/event [A] suppresses a bad entity/event [C]
Premise 2: An entity/event [¬A] promotes a bad entity/event [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, both Premise 1 and Premise 2 support that [A] should be brought about.

Template No.3:
Premise 1: An entity/event [A] suppresses a good entity/event [C]
Premise 2: An entity/event [¬A] promotes a good entity/event [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, both Premise 1 and Premise 2 support that [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.4:
Premise 1: An entity/event [A] promotes a bad entity/event [C]
Premise 2: An entity/event [¬A] suppresses a bad entity/event [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, both Premise 1 and Premise 2 support that [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.5:
The argument cannot be instantiated with one of the templates above.

# Important Criteria: Prioritizing entities over events for placeholder.
For choosing placeholder, please prioritize entities over events in the case that an entity itself captures the underlying intent of the argument opposed to the event. However, if the event makes more sense, please choose an event for the placeholder.

# Correct Example
Input: To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don't, we can't have better schools.
Output:
Template No.=1
[A]=raise taxes
[C]=schools
Explanation:
Here, there are 2 possible options for [C] which are "schools" (i.e., entity) and "can't have better schools" (i.e., event). Since the entity is the top priority and the second option does not work with template 1 because it is a suppressed relation, "schools" is cchosen for [C].
Also, [A] and [C] are taken directly from the input text. For example, "raising taxes" as [A] also sounds correct, but the term "raising" is not mentioned in the input text. That is why "raise taxes" is chosen for [A]. Because the argument believes that "raise taxes" promote "schools" while not "raise taxes" suppress "school". he conclusion is implicit that “Premise 1 supports that raise taxes should be brought about.” Thus, Template No.=1 is selected.

# Wrong Example
Input: To get better schools, we have to raise taxes. If we don't, we can't have better schools.
Output:
Template No.=1
[A]=raising taxes
[C]=can't have better schools
Explanation:
Here, there are 2 possible options for [C] which are "schools" (i.e., entity) and "can't have better schools" (i.e., event). However, "can't have better schools" as [C] is incorrect because it is an event instead of the entity of "schools" which already makes sense.
Also, "raising taxes" as [A] is incorrect because the placeholder is not taken directly from the text. Here "raising taxes" is chosen as [A] but the word "raising" does not appear in the input text. Therefore the correct correct choice for [A] is "raise taxes".

# Example1
Input: If you can't prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny, then he's been faithful to his wife.
Output:
Template No.=1
[A]=prove that Ken had an affair with the nanny
[C]=he's been faithful to his wife

# List of Templates
Template No.1:
Premise 1: An entity/event [A] suppresses a good entity/eventn [C].
Premise 2: An entity/event [A] or [A'] suppresses a good entity/event [C] or [C'], where [A] is ≠ to [A']  and [C] is ≠ [C']. [A'] is the ⊆ of [A] and [C'] is the ⊆ of [C]. This premise supports Premise 1.
Conclusion: Therefore, Premise 1 supports that [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.2:
Premise 1: An entity/event [A] promotes a bad entity/event [C].
Premise 2: An entity/event [A] or [A'] promotes a bad entity/event [C] or [C'], where [A] is ≠ to [A'] and [C] is ≠ [C']. [A'] is the ⊆ of [A] and [C'] is the ⊆ of [C]. This premise supports Premise 1.

# Correct Example
Input: I know four poor families. They are lazy drug addicts. Therefore, all poor people are lazy drug addicts.
Output:
Template No.=2
[A]=all poor people
[C]=lazy drug addicts
[A']=four poor families
[C']=
Explanation:
Here, there are 2 possible options for [A'] which are "four poor families" (i.e., entity) and "know four poor families" (i.e., event). Both options make sense as placeholders but since the entity is the top priority, "four poor families" is chosen for [A'].
Also, [A], [C], and [A'] are taken directly from the input text. For example, "every poor people" as [A] also sounds correct, but the term "every" is not mentioned in the input text. That is why "four poor families" is chosen as [A]. Because the argument believes that "four poor families" is "lazy drug addicts" supports "all poor people" is "lazy drug addicts", the conclusion is implicit that "Premise 1 supports that "all poor people" should not be brought about." Thus, Template No.=2 is selected.  

# Wrong Example

Explanation:
Here, there are 2 possible options for [A'] which are "four poor families" (i.e., entity) and "know four poor families" (i.e., event). However, "know four poor families" as [A'] is incorrect because it is an event instead of the entity which already makes sense.
Also, "every poor people" as [A] is incorrect because the placeholder is not taken directly from the text. Here "every poor people" is chosen as [A] but the word "every" does not appear in the input text. Therefore the correct one to fill [A] is "all poor people".

# Example1
Input: "My mother has always told me not to drink milk after eating fish because she knows a friend whose skin got patched after drinking milk and eating fish together. Besides, many other people have told me the same thing so it must be true."

Here, there are 2 possible options for [A] which are "Hanes underwear" (i.e., entity) and "wear Hanes underwear" (i.e., event). Both options make sense  as placeholders, but since the entity is the top priority, "Hanes underwear" is chosen for [A].

For example, "Chicago Bulls player Michael Jordan" as [X] also sounds correct, but the term "Chicago Bulls player" is not mentioned in the input text. That is why "Michael Jordan" is chosen as [X]. Because the argument belive that "Michael Jordan" promote the premise "Hanes underwear" good for "you", the conclusion is implicit that "Premise supports that  "Hanes underwear" should be brought about." Thus, Template No.=3 is selected
