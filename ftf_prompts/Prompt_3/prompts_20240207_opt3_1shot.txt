=== fallacy_structure_analysis: False Dilemma ===
# Task
Identify the underlying structure of an argument of False Dilemma.
Given a list of fallacy templates, your task is to choose a template that best describes the underlying fallacy structure, filling the template's placeholders.
Please follow the Output Format!!!
# List of Templates
Template No.1:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] promotes a good entity/action [C].
Premise 2: The absence of an entity/action [A] suppresses a good entity/action [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should be brought about.

Template No.2:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] suppresses a bad entity/action [C]
Premise 2: The absence of an entity/action [A] promotes a bad entity/action [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should be brought about.

Template No.3:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] suppresses a good entity/action [C]
Premise 2: The absence of an entity/action [A] promotes a good entity/action [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.4:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] promotes a bad entity/action [C]
Premise 2: The absence of an entity/action [A] suppresses a bad entity/action [C].
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.5:
There is either no consequence in the argument, or the argument cannot be instantiated with one of the templates above.

# Output Format
Template No.=[No.]

Template No.1:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] suppresses a good entity/action [C].
Premise 2: An entity/action [A] or [A'] suppresses a good entity/action [C] or [C'], where [A] is not equivalent to [A'] and [C] is not equivalent [C']. [A'] is the subset of [A] and [C'] is the subset of [C]. This premise supports Premise 1.
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.2:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] promotes a bad entity/action [C].
Premise 2: An entity/action [A] or [A'] promotes a bad entity/action [C] or [C'], where [A] is not equivalent to [A'] and [C] is not equivalent [C']. [A'] is the subset of [A] and [C'] is the subset of [C]. This premise supports Premise 1.
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should not be brought about.

Template No.3:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] promotes a good entity/action [C].
Premise 2: An entity/action [A] or [A'] promotes a good entity/action [C] or [C'], where [A] is not equivalent to [A'] and [C] is not equivalent [C']. [A'] is the subset of [A] and [C'] is the subset of [C]. This premise supports Premise 1.
Conclusion: Therefore, [A] should be brought about.

Template No.4:
Premise 1: An entity/action [A] suppresses a bad entity/action [C].
